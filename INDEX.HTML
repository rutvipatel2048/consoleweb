    <h1>Console Project</h1>
    <p>Visual Studio is an Integrated Development Environment(IDE) developed by Microsoft to develop GUI(Graphical User Interface), console, Web applications, web apps, mobile apps, cloud, and web services, etc. With the help of this IDE, you can create managed code as well as native code.</p>
    <p>A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard. It is a rudimentary interface in which the monitor provides the output and the keyboard is used for input. While any computer with a monitor and keyboard may be considered a console, the term most often refers to a system used to control one or more servers</p>
